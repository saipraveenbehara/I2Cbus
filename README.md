# I2Cbus
use I2C scanner to find the address and then check I2C bus example and code accordingly.
the resistor shown in the picture is not mandatory for less devices connected to bus but when using more devices use a pull up resistor from value between 2k ohm to 10k ohm to make the pins high as default.
